#[textbook][2] You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge. Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cubeâ€™s surface area as output. 

edge = int(input("Enter the edge: "))
area = 6*edge**2
print(f"The area of cube is {area}")
